# Exp3-IXrl algorithm with SARSA Agent in Graphical Network Environment

## Running the experiments

Run the file **train-SARSAxCCE.py**. Make sure the folder dependences follow the paths of your setup. When this process has completed, you will notice the following files saved in **/GraphicalNetwork/runs**: 'SARSA_q_tables.pkl', 'SARSA_cce.pkl', 'graphs.pkl'.

Run the file **test-SARSAxCCE.py**. Make sure the folder dependences follow the paths of your setup. When this process has completed, you will notice the following files saved in **/GraphicalNetwork/runs**: 'full_TEST_all_zetas.pkl', 'full_TEST_cce_percentagess.pkl'', 'full_TEST_dists.pkl', 'full_TEST_paths.pkl', and 'full_TEST_zetavalues.pkl'.


## Visualizing results

Run the file **eval.py**. Make sure the folder dependences follow the paths of your setup.
