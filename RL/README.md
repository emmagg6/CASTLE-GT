## RL Folder for CCE in Single Agent, Dynamic Environment of DARPA's CASTLE CC2 security network.


CC2 is decribed in the CybORG/README.md and shows an adversarial, dynamic network environment with a consistant topology and single-time actions. 

To install CybORG (v2) : https://github.com/cage-challenge/cage-challenge-2/blob/main/CybORG/CybORG/Tutorial/0.%20Installation.md 


### IN THIS FOLDER

This RL folder contains a 'implementation' folder and 'cage-challenge-2-main' adapted from our private repo -- contains editted 'CybORG' and training and evaluating methods for our PPO Blue Agents and Approximate CCE methods. A 'fresh' import of CybORG from CC2 is added as a submodule from the CASTLE CHALLENGE 2 repository in the 'CyBORG' folder.
