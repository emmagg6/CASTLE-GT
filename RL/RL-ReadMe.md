## RL Folder for CCE in Single Agent, Dynamic Environment of DARPA's CASTLE CC2 security network.


CC2 is decribed in the CybORG/README.md and shows an adversarial, dynamic network environment with a consistant topology and single-time actions. 


### IN THIS FOLDER

This RL folder contains a 'operations' folder which is the 'maintaining-operations' folder in our private repo -- contains editted 'CybORG' and 'extenstions' to evaluating PPO Blue Agents and the 'BlueGen' Agent. The cotraining framework that works is in the folder 'cotraining-framework-2'. A 'fresh' import of CybORG from CC2 is added as a submodule from the CASTLE CHALLENGE 2 repository in the 'CyBORG' folder.
