# Creation on MARL system in CC4

CC4: https://github.com/cage-challenge/cage-challenge-4


In this complex, dynamic environment that is a random size (initialized randomly at start) and provides an asyncronous setting due to assymetric time-ticks for actions, an approximate course correllated equilibrium will be computed "on top of" the MARL agents, taking the adversarial invaders into account as part of the environment.
