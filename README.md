# CASTLE-GT
Game Theory Model for heuristic of the CASTLE MARL interaction in the 2-player adversarial game.

In the folder *GameTheory-SetUp* contains some basic (first pass), very simple, versions of the 2-player interaction game with game theoretic dynamics.

In the folder *DEMO* is the current work toward a pygame interface of an OpenSpiel game set-up for the DARPA PI meeting.

In the folder *MARL* is the current work toward a trained MARL integration into this environment and OpenSpiel API. First pass with tabular Q-learners. The eventual reasoning behind this is to run a MARL Nash solver with the Q-learning agents.
